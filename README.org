* vagrant-vm-with-ovs
This project provides vagrant VMs with openvswitch.

** Purpose
To create an environment includes OpenFlow sitches and a OpenFlow Controller.

** Backgrounds
It is difficult to install openvswitch into Mac OS X or Windows.
If it is possible to create openvswitch envirionment on VMs,
I can study OpenFlow switches without Linux as a host OS.

** TODOs
- install openvswitch and start
- install Trema controller
- connect openvswithes to Trema controller

** DONEs
- creates openvswitch rpms for centos64
